### Exercise: Analyzing Student Exam Scores

#### Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to practice working with one-dimensional arrays in Java. You will create a program that analyzes student exam scores, calculates basic statistics, and provides insights into the data.

#### Instructions:

You are given an array of student exam scores (integers) for a particular subject. Your task is to implement a Java program that performs the following tasks:

-	Calculate the average score of all students.
-	Find and display the highest score achieved by any student.
-	Count and display the number of students who scored above the average score.
-	Calculate and display the percentage of students who scored above the average.

#### Guidelines:

1.	Create a Java class named StudentExamAnalyzer.
2.	Inside the class, define a method calculateAverage that calculates the average score of the students.
3.	Define a method findHighestScore that finds and returns the highest score in the array.
4.	Implement a method countAboveAverage that counts the number of students who scored above the average.
5.	Create a method calculatePercentage that calculates the percentage of students who scored above the average.
6.	In the main method, create an array with sample student exam scores.
7.	Call the methods you've implemented to calculate the required statistics and display the results.
